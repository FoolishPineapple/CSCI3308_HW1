        <h1>Smith, Brant</h1>
        <p>I am a Junior at CU studying computer science and math. I like computer science because it gives us powerful tools with which we can study our world. I am also a member of the national raft racing team and will be headed to China in August to compete in the world championship. In my free time I enjoy kayaking, skiing, and climbing. I am currently the president of the CU Kayaking Club. </p>
